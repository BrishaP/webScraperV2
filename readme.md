    "summary": " Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power review: Truly epic and divisive . It's sure to anger the die-hards . When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission .  The Rings of Power is Amazon's latest claim for the throne of fantasy TV . HBO Max is fighting this fight with a tight focus, delivering House of the Dragon, which is focused solely on the silver-maned folks at House Targaryen . So far, so far, it's my favorite of the two .  The Rings of Power starts off in beautiful Valinor, also known as the Blessed Realms . Instead of introducing a whole world at once, they're giving us dedicated bits about certain specific characters .  Morfydd Clark does well with these scenes, and she quickly becomes a protagonist you're rooting for . She spends much of her time talking with Elrond, who Robert Aramayo plays very well . The scares were done properly well, and the scale and size felt true .  Some things in Lord of the Rings are different from the books . Amazon didn't acquire rights to all pieces of Tolkien's lore . The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales and The History of Middle-earth are all not on the table .  The Rings of Power's Harfoots look like Hobbits, as a group of smaller and hairier creatures who all have a sense of mischief . The show doesn't explain their connection to Hobbits but I'm told they can be seen as subspecies of Hobbits .  The big story in episode 2 revolves around Elrond's new mission, which sends him to the realm of Dwarves . As The Rings of Power delivers well-rounded characters, you feel the warmth throughout the show . One concern I had going into the series was a lack of star p stars .  When it's at its best, it feels like a Lord of the Rings movie that comes free with your Amazon Prime membership . The cast, so far, all seem well-suited to their roles . The series may accomplish the inverse: making stronger stars through their performance on a massive stage .  Tolkien fans may smite the show with reactions online, but if the show finds a loving audience that can look past those differences? It might be out of the die-hard fans' hands . Now that the whole season is aired, check out our guide to Rings of Power season 2 .  Henry T. Casey is a managing editor at Tom’s Guide covering streaming media, laptops and all things Apple . He's also covered the wild world of professional wrestling for Cageside Seats .  If Amazon decides to change canon, they're basically saying they can create a better world and story than Tolkien . This is a guy who created LANGUAGES from scratch . The Silmarillion is epic. It ties everything in the LotR universe together and gives the complete story of why the world exists .  Apple Intelligence Writing Tools have driven me back to Pages on my Mac — here’s why . I used Apple Intelligence to create a Memory Movie from my photos — here's how it went .  New York Times Strands today — hints, spangram and answers for game #210 (Sunday, September 29 2024) Tom's Guide is part of Future plc ."
